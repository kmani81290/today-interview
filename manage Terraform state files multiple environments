“We store Terraform state remotely using an Azure Storage Account with a backend configuration, enabling state locking and versioning.
Each environment—Dev, QA, and Prod—has a separate state file using different backend keys or separate storage containers.

In Azure DevOps pipelines, we run terraform init and terraform plan in the CI stage to validate changes.
The terraform apply step is executed only after manual approval, especially for production environments.

Rollback is not automatic in Terraform; if an issue occurs, we either re-apply the previous stable code version or use state file versions to restore infrastructure.
All Terraform code is version-controlled in Git.”
