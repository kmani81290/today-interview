CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps for a production application?

We used Azure Repos for source control with a GitFlow branching strategy.
CI pipelines were built using Azure DevOps YAML pipelines to trigger on pull requests and main branch merges.
The pipeline had multiple stages—Build, Terraform Plan, and Terraform Apply.
For CD, Terraform was integrated using Azure service connections, with separate state files per environment.
Manual approvals were enabled for production deployments.
Rollback was handled using Terraform state and versioned infrastructure code.
Secrets were stored in Azure Key Vault and accessed securely in pipelines.”
